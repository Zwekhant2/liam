        <p>Logan Paul has begun the process of buying back NFTs from fans who lost money in his failed cryptocurrency
            game.</p>

        <p>The YouTube star announced the game CryptoZoo in 2021 but it never materialized, despite fans spending
            millions on game tokens.</p>

        <p>Paul, 28, has now said he will buy back the NFTs, on the condition that fans who accept do not sue him.</p>
 
        <blockquote>
            <p>This buy-back is a way for me to make whole those who intended to play CryptoZoo.</p>
            <p>The buy-back is not intended to compensate those who gambled on the crypto market and lost.</p>
        </blockquote>
